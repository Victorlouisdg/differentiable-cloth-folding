# Folding Variations

This directory contains 3 variations of the [folding.ipynb](https://github.com/Victorlouisdg/differentiable-cloth-folding/blob/master/folding.ipynb) notebook.
The `folding_5x5.ipynb` notebook use a lower cloth resultion, but the actuation is the same as before, both corners are actuated at the same time (= concurrently).
The other two notebooks show what happens when we try to actuated the corners one by one instead of together (= consecutively). 

The difference in actuation is show in the figure below.
